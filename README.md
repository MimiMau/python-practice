Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maua, an aspiring software engineer/ backend coder on a journey to master Python. This repository serves as my learning playground, where I practice exercises, mini-projects, and small management systems as I develop my coding skills.  

What you'll probably find here.
- Loops and conditions  
- Nested structures  
- Dictionaries and data handling  
- Mini projects like small management systems  
- And lots of experiments as I learn!  

About Me
- Currently focused on Python fundamentals. I am just finishing month two since I started. 
- Passionate about solving problems and building things from scratch  
- Sharing my journey to track growth and inspire others

Goal: To turn learning into building real, practical projects.  

Feel free to follow along or leave tips!
